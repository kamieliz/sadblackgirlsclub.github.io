                <p>If you are being harassed by a member of Sad Black Girls Club, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact <a href="https://sadblackgirlsclub.slack.com/team/kamariaeliz" target="_blank">@kamariaeliz</a> directly via DM.</p>
                <p>This code of conduct applies to Sad Black Girls Club spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Sad Black Girls Club outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Sad Black Girls Club members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from Sad Black Girls Club based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Sad Black Girls Club spaces and behavior towards people who are not in Sad Black Girls Club.</p>
                <p>In order to protect volunteer admins from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>
                <p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Sad Black Girls Club members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>
